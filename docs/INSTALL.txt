INSTALLATION
------------

- Prerequisite software:

1. Download MySQL-server. Be sure to download version 4.0. 
   http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html

2. Download mysql-connector-j. Be sure you download version 3.0.x as
   there is a known bug in 3.1.x when used with CentraView. We
   reccommend version 3.0.16-ga. Note that the URL given below does
   not contain a download link for this specific version. Please click
   the "Connector/J" link, then click the "Connector/J 3.0 Downloads"
   which is found on the right side of the next page.*
   http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/
   
3. Download JBoss 3.0.8 with integrated Tomcat4.  This can be found
   here: 
   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22866&package_id=16946&release_id=163978
   
4. Download Sun Java 2 SDK 1.4.2
   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html
   
5. Install Sun java following the directions given.

6. export PATH=<pathtojavainstall>/bin:$PATH

7. export JAVA_HOME=<pathtojavainstall>

8. Unpack jboss to a location of your choice. This is where you will be
   installing both JBoss and CentraView. We will refer to this folder as
   <path-to-jboss> from now until the end of this document.

9. Copy mysql-connector-j jar file into <path-to-jboss>/server/default/lib/

10. Install MySQL however you want to. (recommended mysql rpms)

- That takes care of all the prerequisites

11. Download centraview package that includes centraview.ear,
    mysql-service.xml, cvdb.sql, fs.zip. 
    
12. Copy centraview.ear and mysql-service.xml to 
	/<path-to-jboss>/server/default/deploy/
    
13. Create a directory somewhere on your local disk for the centraview
    filesystem, (where user files are stored) and unzip the file fs.zip
    into that folder.
    
14. Import cvdb.sql into a new centraview database.
    mysqladmin -u root -p"password" create cvdb
    mysql -u root -p"password" cvdb < "cvdb.sql"
    
15. Set up a centraview user that has ALL PRIVILEGES on the
    cvdb database.
    GRANT all privileges on cvdb.* TO "newuser"@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    GRANT all privileges on cvdb.* TO "newuser"@"HOSTNAME" IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    
16. Update the "cvfolderlocation" setting in the database, with the full
    path to where you unziped the fs.zip file. Do this by logging into
    the cvdb database and executing the following command:
    
    mysql -u "user" -p"password" cvdb
    UPDATE cvfolderlocation SET Detail = '/Path/to/filesystem';

17. Edit mysql-service.xml to allow jboss to connect to the database:

 <properties>
        <config-property name="ConnectionURL" type="java.lang.String">jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/DATABASE-NAME-HERE</config-property>
        <config-property name="DriverClass" type="java.lang.String">org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver</config-property>
        <!--set these only if you want only default logins, not through JAAS -->
        <config-property name="UserName" type="java.lang.String">USERNAME-HERE</config-property>
        <config-property name="Password" type="java.lang.String">PASSWORD-HERE</config-property>
 </properties>

    Note that you'll be changing the three values "DATABASE-NAME-HERE",
    "USERNAME-HERE", and "PASSWORD-HERE".


18. Remove the files <path-to-jboss>/server/default/lib/mail.jar and <path-to-jboss>/server/default/deploy/mail-service.xml

19. cd <path-to-jboss>/bin

20. sh run.sh

21. Browse to the http://hostname:8080/centraview/

22. Login with user admin, password admin.

You are now finished installing CentraView. 

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

1. Chart images don't display in Sales and Support modules

   On some linux systems, users have reported that the chart images do
   not show up in Sales and Support. This is a known issue with the
   JFreeChart libraries used to generate these chart images. There is
   a simple solution, however. 
 
   You have to add the java.awt.headless option in your tomcat4.conf: 
   
JAVA_OPTS="-Xincgc -Xss128k -Xms1024M -Xmx1024M -server -Djava.awt.headless=true" 
   
   is our recommended setting. The java.awt.headless=true fixes the
   chart issues.

   In some installations, you may have to set the JAVA_OPTS by changing
   the value inside the startup script in <path-to-jboss>/bin/run.sh

2. We have found a bug in Struts that causes an issue with some of our
   code. However, we've found an easy configuration change that solves
   these issues. 
   
   Simply edit <JBOSSHOME>/server/default/conf/log4j.xml. Nested under
   the <root> element, add <priority value="INFO"/>. Other values may
   be fine too, as long as it isn't "DEBUG". 
    
   So starting on line 164 you should have: 
    
<root> 
  <priority value="INFO"/> 
  <appender-ref ref="CONSOLE"/> 
  <appender-ref ref="FILE"/> 
</root> 
     
   This should resolve some of the issues that have been seen.
