The greatly simplified CentraView bundled with JBoss and MySQL
connector/j install.

1. Setup the Filesystem
   Unzip the fs.zip where you want the CentraView files to be.

2. Set up your database.
   mysqladmin -u root -p create cvdb
   mysql -u root -p cvdb < cvdb.sql
   mysql -u root -p cvdb
   Then at the MySQL prompt tell it where you put the filesystem in
   step 1:
   UPDATE cvfolderlocation SET Detail = '/Path/to/fs/';
   exit

3. Edit the mysql-ds.xml file, changing the <user-name> and <password>
   entries to a MySQL user that has rights over the cvdb database.

4. If you have the Sun Java JDK installed and set up you should simply
   be able to execute jboss-4.0.2/bin/run.sh or on Windows
   jboss-4.0.2/bin/run.bat.

   If you don't have it installed you need to download it from
   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html and make
   sure your JAVA_HOME environment variable set.

Now we agree this process could be easier, so we have plans to make
it so, maybe we will even get gutsy enough to ship the Sun JRE 
with it ;-)

If you have problems with this, post to our forum on
http://sf.net/projects/centraview or join the centraview-users mailing
list and ask a question there.
